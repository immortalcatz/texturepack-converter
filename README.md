# texturepack-converter
Designed to convert older texture packs to the more modern Minecraft file structure.

Currently will convert terrain.png from 1.4.5 format, has maps set up for 1.4.5/1.3/1.2.4/1.2.3 although a way to switch between them and a nice GUI is still in the works. Currently if you wish to use a different texture format the names variable in Main will need to be changed to the appropriate version map.

Put terrain_converter.jar in the same folder as the desired terrain.png and run terrain_converter.
